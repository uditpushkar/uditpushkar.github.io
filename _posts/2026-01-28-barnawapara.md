## Conservation

I live in the state of Chatisgarh. It is the 9th largest state areawise in the coutry but very few folks believe that it is indeed larger than Bihar, Assam and Tamil Nadu. <!--more-->Chattisgarh comprises of around 40% area as forest. Yes way above than targeted national average of 33%. It has 3 National Park 



1. Guru Ghasidas National Park 
2. Kanger Valley National Park 
3. Indravati NP 

  Out of these, Kanger Valley got rid of naxal movement in the last few years. Indravati National Park still has some naxal elements. The management of Indravati NP is will take more time. But Indravati has recorded presence on Tigers unlike Kanger Valley NP, which has no tigers yet. Chattisgarh has 4 tigers reserves namely 

  1. Udanti Sitanadi TR in 2009
  2. Indravati TR in 2009 
  3. Achanakmar TR in 2009 
  4. Gurughasi Das - Tamor Pingla TR in 2024

  The last TR Gurughasi-Tamor Pingla is the 3rd largest Tiger Reserve in the country after Nagarjuna Sagar and Amrabad in Telangana. 


  Enough about the tid-bits. I on the other went out to explore Barnawapara Wildlife Santuary along with my wife. Anjali and I reached the night before nd stayed at the Paryatan Gram Resort run by Forest Department. We planned our safari in the morning. 


## The Safari 

The jeep safari starts at the Rawan Barrier. The Wildlife Santuaries are less protected than NP and TRs. So they allow all vehicles to pass thorough a road cutting across the WLS. So this road connects Chattisgarh and Orissa. On this road are several entry barriers which gives access to the WLS. 

The forest is dry decisous type domimated by **Sal Trees**, which sheds thier leaf once in a year.
